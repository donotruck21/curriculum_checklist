## "Top Twenty" Curriculum Checklist
### What Makes a Great Course?
Over time Coding Dojo has built many great pieces of curriculum.  However, entire courses that work effectively are less common.  Other Dojo documents discuss concepts around effective curriculum (Simplicity, Efficiency, Assignment Landscape, Student Emotions, Professionalism).  This document tries to be more concrete.  Although there is no formula for an "ideal" course, we have identified certain course-level best practices -- 20 in all.  This document intends to list those "Top Twenty" best practices.  

- [ ] Assignment checklist accurate for all assignments: sequence, duration, difficulty, times
- [ ] Assignment Solutions for all mandatory and optional assignments - a clear minimal viable one
- [ ] Walkthrough videos for each Assignment, building out this clear minimal viable Solution
- [ ] Additional Assignment Solutions for some (a gold-plated "A- [ ]" version for advanced students)
- [ ] Lesson Plans for each day, in Learn: main points for lecture, suggested interactions
- [ ] Group Activities for each day, in Learn: ideally two options
- [ ] Sufficient assignments - students should be coding 80% of the time (incl. group activities)
- [ ] Sufficient optional assignments - at least 50% as many as the mandatory assignments
- [ ] Learning Objectives at the course level (no more than 2-3 per week)
- [ ] Course Overview that lays out the Learning Objectives and sets the big picture
- [ ] Course Recap that restates "what we learned" and suggests next steps
- [ ] Chapter Overview mat'ls - how it fits in big picture, local goals/topics, encouragement as needed
- [ ] Chapter Recap mat'ls - restate the big picture, recap local goals/topics, point to next chapter
- [ ] Belt reviewer assignment that is comprehensive, with time in the schedule to include it
- [ ] All Belt Exams include a grading rubric
- [ ] One new Belt Exam added each 2 months (old exams become Reviewers or project ideas?)
- [ ] Project page (post-exam) with appropriately-sized ideas (incl. social good & corporate partners)
- [ ] Ajax mat'l early and often (week 2), to avoid last-minute cramming for the Belt Exam
- [x] Deployment mat'l early and often (week 2), to avoid last-minute cramming for the Belt Exam
- [x] All Belt Exams include deployment and Ajax (and are otherwise up-to-date)
